# schedule-Web-Page
This is a simulator Web schedule project.
A professional simulator web page is being developed for Vancouver CAE's customers to view their upcoming training session schedule. Although the webpage is still under development, 
this project is nearing completion. Additionally, this project consists of four major files: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and a Python application for the web server client.
